The first simply multiplies the balance compensable service charge total by the multiplier.  The second calculation incorporates all of the elements of the multiplier calculation.

AFP code\u003d00 00 13\n*`CBAN`-The sum of the daily ending collected balances (both positive and negative) divided by the number of days in the statement period.  A negative-signed value indicates a negative average NET balance.  If a reserve-adjusted earnings allowance/credit rate is used, this balance may be the same as the investable balance (00 00 40).
