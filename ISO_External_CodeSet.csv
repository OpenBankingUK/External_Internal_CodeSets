Blocked trades have an indicator that prevents the transactions from settling. Once matched, they can settle whenever the freeze is lifted. In this case they will move to FSET. Lifting the freeze can happen anytime during the day and the transaction will be settling in the next settlement cycle which can be the same day if the (international) central securities depository's operates several settlements cycles per day.",SWIFT/Cash Management,Registered,2018-11-01,2018-11-01,,,,,,
